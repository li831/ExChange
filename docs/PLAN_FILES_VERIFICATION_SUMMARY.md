# Plan Files Verification Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Verification Scope**: All plan files in `docs/plans` directory
**Purpose**: Verify endpoint accuracy against official Binance Testnet documentation

---

## Files Examined

1. ✅ `docs/plans/2025-01-22-phase1-mvp-core-engine.md` (2574 lines)
2. ✅ `docs/plans/2025-01-27-phase2-strategy-system.md` (1704 lines)

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #1: Production Endpoint in Phase 1 Example Code ⚠️ FIXED

**Location**: `docs/plans/2025-01-22-phase1-mvp-core-engine.md:725`

**Context**: Task 4 "WebSocket连接管理" → Step 6 "编写手动测试程序验证实时数据"

**Problem**: Example code in `examples/test_websocket.rs` used production WebSocket endpoint instead of testnet.

**Before (WRONG)**:
```rust
let mut ws = BinanceWebSocket::new("wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws");
```

**After (CORRECT)**:
```rust
let mut ws = BinanceWebSocket::new("wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision/ws");
```

**Impact**:
- Example code would have connected developers to PRODUCTION environment during testing
- Could have caused confusion when the example didn't work with testnet API keys
- Risk of accidental production data exposure during development

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

## Verification Results

### Phase 1 Plan (2025-01-22-phase1-mvp-core-engine.md)

**Issues Found**: 1
- Line 725: Production WebSocket endpoint in example code ✅ Fixed

**Endpoint References Verified**:
- All other endpoint references use correct testnet URLs
- REST API: `https://testnet.binance.vision/api` ✓
- WebSocket: `wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision/ws` ✓

**Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED AND CORRECTED**

### Phase 2 Plan (2025-01-27-phase2-strategy-system.md)

**Issues Found**: 0

**Content Verified**:
- Task 1-2: Pine Script grammar and parser (no endpoints)
- Task 3: AST builder (no endpoints)
- Task 4: Technical indicators (pure calculations, no API calls)
- No Binance API endpoint references found

**Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED - NO ISSUES**

---

## Related Fixes

As part of the comprehensive endpoint verification, the following issues were also identified and fixed:

### Critical Fix: Production Endpoint in config.toml

**File**: `trading-engine/config.toml`
**Line**: 7

**Before**:
```toml
ws_endpoint = "wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws"
```

**After**:
```toml
ws_endpoint = "wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision/ws"
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed (documented in ENDPOINT_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md)

## Verification Methodology

1. **Read Official Documentation**:
   - REST API docs: `docs/Binance-api/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api.md`
   - WebSocket docs: `docs/Binance-api/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/web-socket-streams.md`
   - Testnet FAQ: `docs/Binance-api/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/testnet.md`

2. **Identify Correct Endpoints**:
   - REST API: `https://testnet.binance.vision/api`
   - WebSocket: `wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision/ws`

3. **Search Plan Files**:
   - Read all lines in each plan file
   - Search for endpoint references
   - Verify against official documentation

4. **Fix Issues**:
   - Update incorrect endpoints to testnet
   - Maintain consistency across all files

## Recommendations

### 1. Add Endpoint Validation to Code

Consider adding compile-time or runtime validation to prevent accidental production endpoint usage:

```rust
// In config.rs
fn validate_testnet_config(config: &BinanceConfig) -> Result<()> {
    if !config.ws_endpoint.contains("testnet.binance.vision") {
        return Err(anyhow!("WebSocket endpoint must use testnet.binance.vision"));
    }
    if !config.api_endpoint.contains("testnet.binance.vision") {
        return Err(anyhow!("API endpoint must use testnet.binance.vision"));
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

### 2. Environment-Based Configuration

Use environment variables to prevent hardcoding endpoints:

```toml
[binance]
api_endpoint = "${BINANCE_API_ENDPOINT:https://testnet.binance.vision}"
ws_endpoint = "${BINANCE_WS_ENDPOINT:wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision/ws}"
```

### 3. Documentation Updates

Update the following documentation files to reference correct endpoints:
- ✅ config.toml (already fixed)
- ✅ Phase 1 plan (already fixed)
- ✅ Phase 2 plan (no issues found)
- ✅ ENDPOINT_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md (created)

---

## Conclusion

All plan files have been thoroughly verified against official Binance Testnet documentation (2025 version). One issue was identified and corrected:

1. ✅ **Phase 1 Plan Line 725**: Updated example code from production to testnet WebSocket endpoint

Both plan files now correctly reference testnet endpoints only. The system is properly configured for safe testnet development and testing.

**Next Steps**:
- Begin Phase 2 implementation following the corrected plans
- Consider implementing recommended endpoint validation
- Review any additional documentation for endpoint consistency

---

**Verification Complete** ✓

All plan files are now accurate and safe for development use with Binance Testnet.
